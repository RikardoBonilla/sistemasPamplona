  🎯 REQUIRED ANALYSIS AREAS

  1. 🏗️ ARCHITECTURE & DESIGN PATTERNS

  - Is the home/ vs general/ component separation optimal?
  - Are standalone components properly implemented vs NgModules?
  - Is the service structure scalable for future growth?
  - Are SOLID principles and Clean Architecture being followed?

  2. 📱 IONIC/ANGULAR BEST PRACTICES

  - Are Ionic native components being leveraged correctly?
  - Is component lifecycle management adequate?
  - Is the use of Reactive Forms vs Template Forms appropriate?
  - Are IonicModule imports optimized?

  3. 🎨 CSS/SCSS & UI PERFORMANCE

  - Is the CSS variable system well-structured?
  - Are Ionic overrides (--background, --color) efficient?
  - Are there CSS specificity issues or duplicate styles?
  - Does responsive design cover all necessary breakpoints?

  4. 🚀 PERFORMANCE & OPTIMIZATION

  - Is lazy loading correctly implemented?
  - Are there memory leaks in Observable subscriptions?
  - Are images and assets optimized?
  - Is the bundle size acceptable for a landing page?

  5. 🔒 SECURITY

  - Does EmailJS integration expose sensitive data?
  - Are form validations sufficient against XSS?
  - Do environment files properly handle secrets?

  6. 🧪 QUALITY & MAINTAINABILITY

  - Do components have single, well-defined responsibilities?
  - Are critical unit tests missing?
  - Does code comply with ESLint rules and Angular coding standards?
  - Is code documentation sufficient?
